Welcome to my blog! I am going to write come code here or something...

Like this code: 

``` ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

Or maybe I will use a gist.

{% gist 5555251 %}

I also have this other old website called [Mywoot.net][mywoot] that I still run for some reason...

[mywoot]:      http://mywoot.net
